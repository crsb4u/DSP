DA271 - Delighting Analytics Users via Advanced Data Models in SAP Datasphere - Jump Start Session
Session Summary
This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2023 session üëâ DA271 - Delighting Analytics Users via Advanced Data Models in SAP Datasphere.

Analyzing complex business data in the SAP Analytics Cloud solution is massively simplified if modelers prepare their data models well using the SAP Datasphere solution. They can prepare the relevant dimensions of analysis and company KPIs regardless of internal complexity, leverage hierarchies, automate currency conversion, and more. Dig deep into the modeling tools of SAP Datasphere, get hands-on experience modeling an end-to-end case, and quickly prepare analytics that delight business users.

Overview on what you'll learn
In this exercise we leverage the strong modelling capabilities of SAP Datasphere to add business semantics on data that have been ingested from remote sources. The goal is to prepare a flexible, rich, governed & understandable data model to our analytics users that they can subsequently use in their dashboards & data analysis. On the way, you'll get to know many of the modelling marvels that the SAP Datasphere team has added over the last year since TechEd 2022.

Concretely, you'll get to know the following:

Area	Feature
System setup	
Replication flow for efficient and parallel onboarding of many source tables
CSN import for efficient, ad-hoc distribution of data models
Semantic basics around facts, dimensions, and associations
ER model for efficient object overview
Data lineage & dependency lineage of repository entities
Analytic model	
Dimension & attribute selection
Analytical data preview
Measure modelling for calculated measures, restricted measures, constant selection, count distinct & automatic currency conversion
Variable modelling for restricted measures & time-dependency
Labels & internationalization	
Language-independent labels for attributes
Language-dependent labels via text entities that get associated to a dimension via a text association
Hierarchy modelling	
Level-based hierarchies
Classic parent-child hierarchies
Hierarchies with directories to get:
data-driven hierarchy definition
support of text & dimension nodes
language-dependent labels for hierarchies and their nodes
time-dependent hierarchies
Currency conversion	
Adding currency & unit semantics to data layer artefacts
Import of currency conversion data from SAP S/4 into SAP Datasphere
Task chains for parallel execution of multiple data flows
Data integration monitor for inspection of task chain runs
Currency conversion measures in Analytic Model
Prerequisites
Google Chrome Browser
Access to this GitHub repository
Access to a suitable SAP Datasphere system
During TechEd 2023 hands-on sessions, you will be provided with user credentials for a personalized space in the Datasphere system of the SAP Academy.
Subsequent learners will be able to use the Guided Experience Systems for SAP Datasphere
(request your user from here > "Experience SAP Datasphere")
Users can also use their own SAP Datasphere system to run through the exercises with minor adjustments. Since the system will not have the required backend systems available, the data import process will differ. Preparatory exercise 0 offers a dedicated subchapter to cater to this.
Object Model: Download the following model file to your computer: DA271_DataModel - Quick Start.json
Time: 2+ hours
Exercises
Overview on exercises & object model
Exercise 0 - Getting Started - Uploading initial data and data model
Exercise 1 - Build your Analytic Model to prepare data for consumption
‚ö†Ô∏è If you are short on time, you can choose to only do one of the exercises #2, #3 and #4, since they are all independent of each other.

Exercise 2 - Add labels and internationalization
Exercise 3 - Add hierarchies
Exercise 4 - Add currency conversion
